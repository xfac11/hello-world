My first game
I'm 18 years old (19 in august :D) student and I plan to go to college at BTH in game programming ( or something like that) or at University of Sk√∂vde in Game Programming.
I like to play games and I want to know how games work, i am really intressted in games and my dream is to work at a game company (EA, Blizzard etc) or make my own company/team.
